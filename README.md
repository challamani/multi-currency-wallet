# Multi Currency Wallet
Idea to hold the money in multiple currencies. A single wallet amount - should work at multiple countries (USD|GBP|INR) - 

**Core Idea**
International transfers becomes domestic - if we can able to switch the entire wallet amount from one currency to another.

This project is at very beginning phase.

Draft Features: 
1. Wallet rules (Max amount, min amount, wallet conversion charges) 
2. Enable set of countries - who support wallet amount conversion - with very less charges 
3. Wallet default currency (to allow multiple wallets - with unique wallet# prefix with currency-code)
4. Partners integration at each country

To avoid conversion charges for a small amount of transactions, when initiate funds from one country to another. Accountability will be associated to country's National Bank.
